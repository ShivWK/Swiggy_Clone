        question: "What are the Terms and Conditions of using ZestyEats?",
        description: "By accessing or using ZestyEats, users agree to comply with our terms of service. This includes using the platform only for lawful purposes, not engaging in fraudulent activities, and ensuring that the information provided (like delivery address or payment details) is accurate. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts in case of misuse or violation of our policies. ZestyEats also does not guarantee the availability of any menu item or delivery at all times due to restaurant capacity, operating hours, or external circumstances."

    {
        question: "How does ZestyEats handle customer data?",
        description: "At ZestyEats, we respect your privacy. We collect only essential information like name, email, phone number, location, and order history to personalize your experience and improve our services.

    {
        question: "What is your cancellation and refund policy?",
        description: "Orders can be cancelled before the restaurant begins preparing the food. Once the order is in preparation, cancellations may not be accepted. If the cancellation is successful, a full refund is initiated to the original payment method and typically reflects within 5-7 business days. In cases of failed delivery or missing items, users must report the issue within 24 hours for refund or resolution eligibility. ZestyEats holds the right to decline refund requests in cases of suspected misuse or repeated refund demands."
    },

    {
        question: "Are restaurant listings verified?",
        description: "Yes, every restaurant listed on ZestyEats goes through a verification process. We check for necessary licenses, food safety standards, and consistent service quality before allowing them on the platform. However, ZestyEats acts as a facilitator and does not directly cook or deliver food. The quality and hygiene of food remain the responsibility of the respective restaurant, though we encourage customers to leave ratings and reviews that help ensure accountability.",
    },

    {
        question: "Is ZestyEats responsible for food quality?",
        description: "ZestyEats does not prepare food, but we do our best to list only reputable restaurants. We monitor feedback regularly and may take action against restaurants that fail to meet user expectations or violate food safety norms. However, food taste, temperature, and portion size are under the control of the restaurant. If users face any serious quality issues (e.g., stale food, undercooked meals), we encourage them to report it through our support channels, and we'll take necessary action, including blacklisting the restaurant in extreme cases.",
    },
    {
        question: "What are the delivery terms and liabilities?",
        description: "Deliveries are handled either by our partner delivery fleet or by the restaurants themselves. While we strive for timely delivery, delays may occur due to traffic, weather, or unforeseen issues. ZestyEats is not liable for any indirect losses or health consequences arising from the consumption of food. Our liability is limited to refunding the order value in specific valid cases",

    {
        question: "How do I place an order?",
        description: "To place an order, simply browse through nearby restaurants on your homepage. Use filters to sort by rating, cuisine, or delivery time. Once you find a restaurant, tap to open the menu, add desired items to your cart, and proceed to checkout. Choose your preferred payment option (UPI, card, or COD) and place the order. You'll receive a confirmation and can track the order in real-time.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do I track my order?",
        description: "Once your order is placed, you'll see live updates on its status — like “Restaurant Accepted”, “Food Being Prepared”, and “Out for Delivery.” Our delivery map lets you track the delivery executive's location, estimated arrival time, and even contact them if needed. In case the tracking is stuck or incorrect, you can refresh or contact support directly.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I change or cancel my order?",
        description: "You can cancel the order within a few minutes of placing it — ideally before preparation starts. If the restaurant has already begun cooking, cancellation may not be allowed. Changes like adding extra items or updating delivery address are not supported post-order. We recommend double-checking the cart and address before confirming the order.",
    },
    {
        question: "What should I do if my food is delayed?",
        description: "We apologize for any delay in advance. If your food is significantly late beyond the expected delivery window, please contact our support team through the app. In such cases, you may be eligible for compensation in the form of a refund or a discount voucher, depending on the cause of delay.",
    },
    {
        question: "What if I receive the wrong or missing items?",
        description: "We take such issues seriously. Please report the problem via the app within 30 minutes of delivery. Provide photos or description if possible. Our team will verify the claim and initiate a refund or redelivery if applicable. Frequent misuse of this feature may result in account restrictions.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I order from multiple restaurants in one order?",
        description: "Currently, ZestyEats does not support ordering from multiple restaurants in a single order. Each order must be placed separately to ensure timely preparation and delivery. We may add multi-restaurant checkout support in the future.",
    },

    {
        question: "How can I contact customer support?",
        description: "If you have any issues with your order, app usage, or payments, you can reach us. Go to the Help & Support section in the app and email us directly at zestyeatswk@gmail.com. Our support team is available 9 AM to 11 PM, 7 days a week.",
